                <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Shaved ice:</b> A crucial ingredient for both its cold temperature and its crunchy texture.</li>
                        <li><b>Evaporated milk:</b> This ingredient adds both sweetness and a rich, creamy consistency.</li>
                        <li><b>Plantains (or bananas):</b> Halo-halo often includes saba plantains cooked in sugar syrup to both soften and sweeten them.</li>
                        <li><b>Ube (or yams):</b> A layer of cubed purple yams is common in halo-halo, and some versions also include ube jam and a scoop of ube ice cream on top.</li>
                        <li><b>Beans:</b> This ingredient might surprise those who aren't used to halo-halo, but sweetened beans (either red beans or mung beans) lend a welcome chewy texture.</li>
                        <li><b>Coconut:</b> Some recipes utilize shaved coconut, others contain coconut gelatin, but most feature some coconut element.</li>
                        <li><b>Sugar palm fruit and/or jackfruit:</b> These fruits grow abundantly throughout the Philippines, so it stands to reason that they constitute a layer of halo-halo.</li>
                        <li><b>Flan:</b> Not all versions of halo-halo use flan as an ingredient, but some include both this custardy dessert and a scoop of ube ice cream as toppings.</li>
                    </ul>
                <h1>Steps</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If you consult a published halo-halo recipe, you'll find specific measurements and quantities for this dessert's many ingredients. 
                            <br>However, Monsod urges you to feel free to play around and figure out which amounts work best for you. 
                            <br>"Everyone has their own version of halo-halo with different ingredient ratios. 
                            <br>Try it all together to see what you like and adjust the ingredients to your liking!" she insists.
<br>
                            <br>Try serving it in a large bowl rather than in individual glasses.
                            <br>The traditional service style for halo-halo involves layering the different ingredients in individual dishes or cups. 
                            <br>However, if you're serving a group, chef-owner Diana Manalang of Little Chef Little Cafe in New York City encourages you to "build it in a big bowl! 
                            <br>That way, you can scoop everything without spilling it." A large spoon or scooper will allow you to easily portion your halo-halo and to share it with friends.
